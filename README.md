# P4-Utils

P4-utils is an extension to Mininet that makes P4 networks easier to build, run and debug. P4-utils is strongly
inspired by [p4app](https://github.com/p4lang/p4app).

### Installation

First clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nsg-ethz/p4-utils.git
```

Run the installation script:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
````

The install script will use `pip -e` to install the project in editable mode, meaning that every time you update the files
in this repository, either by pulling or doing local edits, the changes will automatically take place without the need of
installing the package again.

#### Uninstall

If you want to uninstall run:

```bash
sudo ./uninstall
```

This will remove all the scripts that were added to `/user/bin` as well as uninstall the python package using `pip`.

### How does it work ?

P4-utils creates virtual networks using mininet and extended nodes that run p4-enabled switches. To create hosts,
mininet uses a bash process running in a network namespace, in order words, all the processes that run within the
network namespaces have an isolated network stack. Switches are software-based switches like Open vSwitch, Linux Bridge,
or BMV2 switches. Mininet uses virtual ethernet pairs, which live in the Linux kernel to connect the emulated hosts and switches.

### Features

P4-utils adds on top of minininet:

 * A command-line launcher (`p4run`) to instantiate networks.
 * A helper script (`mx`) to run processes in namespaces
 * Custom `P4Host` and `P4Switch` nodes (based on the ones provided in the [`p4lang`](https://github.com/p4lang) repo)
 * A very simple way of defining networks using json files (`p4app.json`).
 * Enhances mininet command-line interface: adding the ability of rebooting switches with updated p4 programs and configurations, without the need
 of restarting the entire network.
 * Saves the topology and features in an object that can be loded and queried to extract meaningful information (also build a `networkx` object out of the
 topology)
 * Re-implementation of the `runtime_CLI` and `simple_switch_CLI` as python objects to use in controller code.

### Usage

P4-utils can be executed by running the `p4run` command in a terminal. By default `p4run` will try to find a
topology description called `p4app.json` in your current path. However you can change that by using the `--config` option:

```bash
p4run --config <path_to_json_configuration>
```

You can see the complete list of options with the `-h` or `--help` options.

## Documentation

### Topology Description

To run any topology p4-utils needs a configuration file (`*.json`) that is used by `p4run` to know how to build and configure a
virtual network. All the possible options are listed below:

#### Global Configuration

Set of global settings defined in the first layer of the json object that describe the basic
configuration of our topology. For instance the switch type and compiler options can be set here.

##### `program:`

   * Type: String
   * Value: Path to p4 program
   * Default: None (required if not all switches have a p4 program defined).

   > Program that will be loaded onto all the switches unless a switch you specify a program in the switch conf.

##### `switch:`

   * Type: String
   * Value: path to bmv2 switch executable
   * Default: "simple_switch"

##### `compiler:`

   * Type: String
   * Value: P4 compiler to be used
   * Default: "p4c"

##### `options:`

   * Type: String
   * Value: Compiler options
   * Default: "--target bmv2 --arch v1model --std p4-16"

##### `switch_cli:`

   * Type: String
   * Value: Path to the switch CLI executable
   * Default: 'simple_switch_CLI'

##### `cli:`

   * Type: bool
   * Value: Enables the enhanced mininet CLI. If disabled, the topology will be destroyed right after being created.
   * Default: false

##### `pcap_dump:`

   * Type: bool
   * Value: if enabled a pcap file for each interfaced is saved at `./pcap`
   * Default: false

##### `enable_log:`

   * Type: bool
   * Value: if enabled a directory with CLI and switch logs is created at `.log`
   * Default: false

### Special Modules

During the creation of the network 4 main blocks are used. To make p4utils more modular adding your
own block is allowed.

##### `topo_module`:

Module in charge of building the topology, amongs others it reads the topology object described in
the json configuration file and decides how to configure hosts and switches (i.e Mac and IP address assignment strategy).

##### `controller_module`

The controller module is in charge of configuring switches and populating its tables during
network creation.

##### `topodb_module`

The topologydb module is the object in charge of storing information about the topology and providing and API to extract
useful data.

##### `mininnet_module`

Modified version of the Mininet object. It simply adds a new attribute that contains `p4switches`.

**Setting your own module:**

By default each module will use the already defined objects in p4utils. If you want to add your own
implementation you can indicate that in the `json` file using the following syntax:

```javascript
  "topo_module | controller_module | topodb_module | minininet_module>"
  {
    "file_path": "<path to python object>",
    "module_name": "<name of python file>",
    "object_name": "<name of module object>"
  }
```

> For modules that are already included in the PYTHONPATH you don't have
to specify the "file_path".

#### Topology

The topology subsection of the configuration describes how the addresses are assigned,
the number of hosts and switches and how are they connected.

##### `assignment_strategy:`

When you use the default `topo_module` you can use different assignment strategies.
Assignment strategies are needed due to the fact that p4-switches can work
at any network layer (L2, L3, ...), and thus there is no way to automatically
configure the hosts, and switches without knowing what will switches do.

 * `l2`: all switches in the network are assumed to work at layer 2, thus
 all hosts get assigned to the same subnetwork.

 * `l3`: all switches in the network are assumed to work at layer 3, thus
 all links in the network form a different subnetwork. Hosts can only
 be connected to one switch device which is used to configure the host's gateway.

 * `manual`: can be used when your topology will be formed by heterogeneous
 devices, you have to manually set the IP to each interface and host gateways.

 > By default l2 strategy is used

##### `auto_arp_tables:`

   * Type: bool
   * Value: if set, hosts get their ARP table automatically filled when the network is started. Note: hosts only
   learn the Mac addresses of other hosts within the same subnet.
   * Default: true

##### `links:`

   * Type: list
   * Value: list of links that connect nodes in the topology.
   * Default: None

   Each link is of the form:
   ```python
   ["node1", "node2", {"delay": <in_ms>, "bw": <in_mbps>, "queue_length": <num_packets>, "weight": <link_cost>}]
   ```

   Link characteristics are not mandatory. Also, not all the characteristics have to be defined, you can pick a subset. For the
   characteristics that are not set, the default values are:

   ```python
   link_dict = {'delay': '0ms',
                'bw': Inf,
                'queue_length': 1000,
                'weight': 1
               }
   ```

##### `hosts:`

   * Type: dict
   * Value: dictionary where the keys are the hosts that have to be created.
   * Default: None

   > TODO: add a way to start commands at hosts: this feature will be added soon.

##### `switches:`


   * Type: dict
   * Value: dictionary where the keys are switch names, and the values are switch confs.
   * Default: None
   * Switch Conf Attributes:
      * `cli_input:` path to the CLI-formatted text file that will be used to configure and populate the switch.
      * `program`: path to the p4 program that will be loaded onto the switch. If not specified, the global `program` path is used.

You can find a configuration example, that uses all the fields [here](./p4app_example.json)
